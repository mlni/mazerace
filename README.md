# Mazerace

A two-player in-browser maze game implemented in Clojure/ClojureScript. You can try out the game [here](https://mazerace.herokuapp.com).

The game itself is a remake of a Windows game from nineties that somehow ended up on my harddisk. If you happen to know the original author of the game be sure to let me know so I can credit the author.

# Running

To run locally, build the code by running 

`lein uberjar` 

Then start the resulting package using 

`java -jar target/mazerace.jar`.

# Development

To run the whole thing during development, first clean any artifacts left from building a release package by running `lein clean`.

Start the backend by running `lein run`. Start the clojurescript compiler by running `lein with-profile dev cljsbuild auto`.

# Source organization

The game is composed of the server-side backend in `src` folder and the frontend code in `src-ui`.

The backend embeds a [HTTP-Kit](/http-kit/http-kit) web server and uses core.async to decouple the core game code from websocket handling.

The frontend uses [Reagent](/reagent-project/reagent) for rendering the game as combination of html and svg.
